# Tiny Geth

Tiny Geth is Peter's personal, opinionated "fork" of go-ethereum. It's not a complete fork, rather combined bits and bobs from upstream with some local changes that were rejected upstream.

## Disclaimers

- ***This is a personal project. I take no responsibility for anyone using it and incurring arbitrary losses due to it.***
- ***Unless promised by me personally, there is no API guarantee anywhere in this project, not even on the RPCs.***

## But why?

I want to explore what Geth could be with hands untied, without having to care about breaking some obscure code for that one developer in Nebraska[ยน](https://xkcd.com/2347/).
