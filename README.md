# Tiny Geth

Tiny Geth is Peter's personal, opinionated "fork" of go-ethereum. It's not a complete fork, rather combined bits and bobs from upstream with some local changes that were rejected upstream. I want to explore what Geth could be with hands untied, without having to care about breaking code for that one developer in Nebraska[ยน](https://xkcd.com/2347/).
